-- exportall

exportall(1) is a tool for the execline scripting language
that exports a block into the environment and then
execs into the rest of its command line

-- usage:

exportall { key value ... } prog ...

The block argument to exportall must be
an even number of words corresponding
to environment variable names and their values.
(Note that setenv(3) prohibits "=" in environment
variable names.)

The following script clears the environment
(except for PATH) and then sets HOME and LC_ALL
and execs into /bin/sh:

#!/bin/execlineb -P
exec
exportall {
        HOME /home/yourself
        LC_ALL C.UTF-8
}
/bin/sh
